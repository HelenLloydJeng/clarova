<h1>AI Training Programmes</h1>
    <p>Clarova provides practical, public-sector-ready AI training for executives, governance leads, and communications teams. Our goal is to help you lead, manage, and communicate AI adoption with confidence.</p>

</div>
</section>
<section class="page-content container">
<h2>Why It Matters</h2>

<p>AI adoption is already underway in most public sector organisations — often without strategic oversight. Tools like ChatGPT, Copilot, and AI-assisted platforms are being used daily by staff, often informally and without training, policies, or safeguards.</p>

<p>Our strategic training is designed to help executive leaders, digital governance leads, and communications professionals understand the risks and opportunities of AI, and implement a clear, responsible response framework. This isn’t just about tools — it’s about trust, accountability, and leading change with clarity.</p>

<p>Clarova equips public sector leaders with the situational awareness, governance models, and communications strategy needed to lead AI adoption responsibly and credibly — before policy catches up or crisis hits.</p>

  <h2>AI Training for Communications Teams</h2>
  <p>Comms professionals are already using tools like ChatGPT — often without clear guidance or policy. Our comms-focused training gives teams the confidence, controls, and creative frameworks to use AI responsibly in high-stakes environments.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Scenario-Based Workshops</strong> – Crisis simulations and real-world AI use in stakeholder messaging</li>
    <li><strong>Hands-On Clinics</strong> – Practical sessions using generative tools under supervision</li>
    <li><strong>Policy & Risk Awareness</strong> – Understand platform terms, data risks, and reputational safeguards</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Teams leave with the tools to use AI safely and credibly — without compromising public trust or reputation.</p>
<p>This training can be delivered via webinar or in-house and aligns with NHS and government communications standards.</p>
